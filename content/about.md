I started swimming when I was 5 years old. My parents always told me that I had too much energy, and that was how they were able to calm me down. 21 years later, I have trained and raced with some of the best athletes in the world, and I have been a member of the University of Michigan Men's Varsity Team, the US National Team and the International Swimming League's DC Trident. 

When I attended Michigan, I studied electrical engineering. I found myself into the math-heavy courses, here, and somehow stumbled into machine learning. How fortitous that was! After graduating with my master's degree, I joined KLA, where I currently work on solving finding nanometer-scale defects in semiconductors. 

My guiding principle is "mens sana in corpore sano" â€“ a healthy mind in a healthy body. When I'm not trying to solve machine learning problems, you can probably find me in the pool or gym!
