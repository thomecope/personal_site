My name is Tommy Cope and I am an Algorithms and Machine Learning Engineer at [KLA](https://www.kla.com/). Here, I work on finding nanometer-scale defects in semiconductors with the [RAPID](https://ir.kla.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/117/kla-tencor-announces-new-suite-of-reticle-inspection) team. Before this, I attended the University of Michigan for my undergrad and master's, studying electrical and computer engineering. Go Blue!

I was also previously a professional swimmer, and a member of the US Men's National Team and the DC Trident in the [Internation Swimming League](https://isl.global/).
