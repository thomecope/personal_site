1. Write *something* once a week.

___________________________________

I have a lot I want to talk about... my experience with swimming, my work, and just things I find interesting. Some series that I hope to write in the coming weeks include:
- Reflections on swimming
- My current work in ML
- Hobbies i.e. muay thai, jiu jitsu
- Things that I want to learn more about, i.e. restorative agriculture
